        <p>
          Thermography is an important non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique for inspecting wind turbine blades.
          The approach heats the material and monitors surface temperature evolution, where anomalies may indicate
          subsurface defects due to differences in thermal properties. However, real wind turbine blades present
          complex curved geometries and heterogeneous composite structures, which can lead to non-uniform heating,
          shadowing effects, and difficulties in reliable defect characterisation.
          
          Traditional thermographic inspection methods often assume simplified heat-transfer conditions.
          For blades with curved surfaces, edges, and corners, heat flow paths are not straightforward, which increases
          modelling complexity and may reduce inversion accuracy. These challenges become more pronounced for composite
          blades with anisotropic thermal behaviour, where accurate forward modelling and robust inversion are essential
          for quantitative interpretation.

        <h3>Aims and Objectives</h3>
        <p>
          This UK–Brazil collaboration aims to improve the effectiveness of wind turbine blade inspections by developing
          next-generation thermography reconstruction and inversion methods tailored for complex geometries. The project
          focuses on: (i) developing new induction coil and flash excitation schemes to improve heating uniformity and
          sensitivity to subsurface defects in CFRP/GFRP structures; (ii) developing physics-based time inversion
          approaches to reconstruct thermal data from time to depth, enabling CT-like internal visualisation; and
          (iii) validating the proposed methods with industrial partners and realistic specimens, with extension to
          other curved structures such as offshore thermoplastic pipes.

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
          The project combines advanced excitation design, physics-based reconstruction, and validation on realistic blade
          structures. Two key technical directions are emphasised:
        </p>

        <h4>WP1 — Curved-surface thermal NDT system using eddy-current and flash thermography</h4>
        <p>
          The first work package develops novel excitation configurations to address uneven heating on curved geometries.
          It includes pulse-compression coded excitations (for improved signal-to-noise ratio and defect resolution),
          modular inductive coils adaptable to blade curvature, and controlled flash/LED heating arrays to enable
          uniform surface excitation. The electromagnetic and flash heating units will be integrated to exploit both
          deeper penetration (induction) and rapid surface heating (flash) for efficient screening.

        <h4>WP2 — Reconstruction and inversion for induction heating on curved surfaces</h4>
        <p>
          The second work package focuses on reconstruction and inversion, leveraging wave-based concepts that transform
          diffusive thermal fields into wave-like representations. For induction heating, the volumetric nature of heating
          requires modified transformation kernels and reconstruction strategies, enabling improved internal visualisation
          and more reliable defect localisation in complex structures.

        <h3>Novelty and Expected Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The novelty lies in tailored experimental configurations for curved blade geometries (including coded excitation
          and curvature-adaptive coil/array designs), and advanced reconstruction frameworks that account for realistic
          heat transfer and loss mechanisms. The expected impact includes improved defect detection accuracy and
          maintenance decision support for wind energy assets, with potential transfer to other industries requiring
          composite inspection (for example, aerospace structures).
        </p>

        <h3>Collaboration and Industrial Validation</h3>
        <p>
          The project leverages complementary expertise across the UK and Brazil teams, and aims to validate the proposed
          approaches through real-world inspection schemes with Brazilian stakeholders, including wind turbine blade
          manufacturing contexts and curved industrial components. This ensures that algorithmic and
