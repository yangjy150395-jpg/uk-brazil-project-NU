          The three-year programme brings together a UK–Brazil team led by Northumbria University (UK) and the
          Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), combining expertise in thermal NDE, electromagnetic
          excitation, thermographic imaging, and data interpretation. The collaboration involves senior academic
          support and early-career researchers who contribute to experimental development, data analysis, and
          cross-institution knowledge exchange.

        <p>
          Brazil is expanding wind energy as part of its long-term decarbonisation pathway, and wind turbine blades
          (WTBs) are critical assets whose integrity directly affects safety and operational efficiency. Thermography
          is a widely used non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique for WTB inspection: a controlled heat stimulus
          is applied and the resulting surface temperature evolution is monitored to infer subsurface anomalies that
          alter thermal transport behaviour <sup>[1,2]</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In real blades, conventional thermographic inspection faces key challenges. First, complex curved geometry
          (especially corners and edges) can cause non-uniform heating and shadowing effects, reducing the reliability
          of defect characterisation <sup>[1,2]</sup>. Second, accurate interpretation requires robust forward heat-transfer
          modelling, which becomes computationally demanding and error-prone in complex geometries and for anisotropic
          composite materials <sup>[3]</sup>. Third, many inversion approaches rely on simplified heat-transfer assumptions;
          their accuracy can degrade when heat flow is influenced by complex geometries, heterogeneous materials, and
          varying boundary conditions <sup>[4]</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Figure 1 provides a high-level view of the project context and the overall inspection-to-interpretation workflow
          for curved composite blades, motivating the need for geometry-aware thermography reconstruction and inversion.

        <p>
          To address the above challenges, the project aims to improve the effectiveness of wind turbine blade inspections
          by developing next-generation thermography reconstruction and inversion methods, leveraging complementary UK and
          Brazilian expertise. The focus is on improving the reliability of thermal data acquisition on curved composite
          surfaces, and enabling more interpretable, physics-consistent reconstruction for defect assessment
          <sup>[3,4]</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As illustrated in Figure 2, the methodology includes enhancing thermal excitation and measurement quality for
          curved blades. This is achieved through advanced excitation strategies, such as coded/pulse-compression concepts
          that improve signal-to-noise ratio and resolution, and coil/excitation configurations designed to better adapt
          to curved geometries <sup>[5]</sup>. These developments target more uniform, repeatable heating and more informative
          thermal responses for subsequent interpretation.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Figure 3 summarises the reconstruction and inversion direction: the project advances thermography reconstruction
          by combining physics-based understanding with modern learning-based tools, aiming for robust performance under
          realistic heat-transfer conditions. In particular, wave-inspired thermal reconstruction concepts and physics-informed
          learning (for example, incorporating physical loss and constraints during model training) are used to improve the
          fidelity and interpretability of reconstructed results while remaining adaptable to different blade designs and
          operating scenarios <sup>[6]</sup>.
