      <h1>What is ECPT</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        Eddy Current Pulsed Thermography (ECPT), also known as induction thermography, is an active infrared
        thermography technique for non-destructive evaluation of conductive materials and structures.<sup>[1][4]</sup>

          <p>
            Infrared thermography is widely used in non-destructive testing because it enables non-contact, wide-area
            inspection and fast visualisation of subsurface anomalies through surface temperature evolution.<sup>[1]</sup>
            In active thermography, an external stimulus introduces heat, and a thermal camera records the transient
            response. Defects and material variations modify heat generation or heat flow, producing measurable thermal
            contrast on the surface.<sup>[1]</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            ECPT provides the stimulus electromagnetically. A pulsed (or modulated) magnetic field induces eddy currents
            in an electrically conductive target, producing rapid heating that is strongly linked to electrical and magnetic
            properties. This coupling is valuable for detecting surface-breaking cracks and near-surface discontinuities
            that disturb current flow.<sup>[2][4]</sup>

            In ECPT, an excitation coil generates a time-varying magnetic field. The field induces eddy currents within the
            skin depth of the specimen, and Joule losses produce a localised temperature rise. For ferromagnetic targets,
            additional loss mechanisms can contribute to heating depending on the excitation configuration and material
            state.<sup>[2][4]</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Defects such as cracks, corrosion features, and inclusions perturb current density and alter heat generation and
            diffusion pathways. An infrared camera records the transient surface temperature sequence, enabling defect
            visualisation and quantitative feature extraction (for example, temporal contrast or phase-like metrics under
            modulated excitation).<sup>[2][3][4]</sup>

            ECPT and induction thermography are commonly applied to surface crack detection in steel components, rails,
            gears, and other safety-critical metallic parts. The technique is attractive for automation because it can be
            non-contact and produces intuitive thermal images that support rapid screening.<sup>[3][4]</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond crack detection, ECPT has been investigated for characterising corrosion-related damage, material
            degradation, and other discontinuities where electromagnetic and thermal responses provide complementary
            sensitivity. Excitation coil design and configuration (for example, line coils, Helmholtz coils, and yoke-based
            arrangements) strongly influence heating uniformity and inspection coverage.<sup>[2][4]</sup>

          <p>
            Wind turbine blade (WTB) structures often involve composite materials (GFRP and CFRP), adhesive joints, and
            layered architectures. Thermography has been studied for detecting delamination-like features and internal
            structures in WTB-related composites, including outdoor inspection approaches that exploit solar excitation and
            environmental transients.<sup>[5][6]</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            In laboratory and monitoring contexts, alternative heating strategies (for example, laser-based thermography)
            have also been explored for WTB inspection, particularly when non-contact operation and large-area coverage are
            required. These studies motivate modelling and reconstruction methods that account for complex geometry and
            anisotropic heat transfer in blade structures.<sup>[7]</sup>
