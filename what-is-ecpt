          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Eddy Current Pulsed Thermography (ECPT) is an active infrared thermography technique that combines
            electromagnetic excitation and transient thermal imaging. It is used in non-destructive testing when
            rapid, non-contact inspection is needed across a relatively large area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared with point-based sensing, ECPT provides an image sequence that captures how the surface temperature
            evolves over time after excitation. This time dependent thermal response often makes defects more visible,
            especially when the defect changes local electrical current flow or heat diffusion.

          <h2>Physical principle</h2>
          <p>
            A coil generates a transient magnetic field. In a conductive target, this induces eddy currents.
            The eddy currents produce Joule heating, which forms a heat source close to the surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Defects such as cracks, corrosion, or material discontinuities disturb current density and the subsequent
            heat flow. An infrared camera records the transient temperature field on the surface, and the defect is
            identified from thermal contrast or from features extracted from the time sequence.

          <h2>Application scenarios</h2>
          <p>
            ECPT is widely used for metallic inspection, including surface and near-surface crack detection,
            rolling contact fatigue, and corrosion related damage. Coil and magnetic circuit design can be adapted
            to improve heating uniformity and to handle complex geometry such as edges.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same framework can be extended with signal processing, for example phase based analysis, to improve
            defect visibility and to reduce the influence of non-uniform heating. This supports both qualitative
            inspection and quantitative characterisation in some settings.

          <h2>Simple view for wind turbine blades</h2>
          <p>
            Wind turbine blades are typically composite structures (GFRP and CFRP) where defects include delamination,
            debonding, core damage, cracks, and erosion-related degradation. Thermography is attractive because it is
            non-contact and can cover large areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            ECPT is most directly applicable when the target region is electrically conductive, for example CFRP parts
            or hybrid structures with conductive layers. For non-conductive regions, related active thermography methods
            can be used with alternative heat sources. In all cases, reconstruction and inversion of thermal data can
            improve detectability on curved, large-scale blade geometries.
